          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>As an SEO Strategist for a digital solutions company for the automotive industry I found myself spending a lot of time building webpages on various platforms like Wordpress and hacking a lot of code to make the pages prettier. I enjoyed what I was psuedo-learning, but I decided to attend the part-time Intro To Programming course with Epicodus because I wanted to truly be able to read and write code.  So here I am.  Rock you like a hurricane.</p>
          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>I love to travel and spend time out doors when I can. Time spent with friends going hiking, playing in a kickball league, camping at music festivals, shooting archery, white water rafting or just tubing down the Clackamas, these are all of my favorite things. I'm known to take an impromptu road trip or hopscotch across the country by plane for a couple of weeks at a time.</p>
