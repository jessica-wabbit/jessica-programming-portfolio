          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>I graduated from <span class="namedrop">Belmont University</span> in Nashville TN back in 2013 with a <em>Double Degree</em>.  I have a <strong><em>Bachelor of Arts in Spanish</em></strong> and a <strong><em>Bachelor of Business Administration</em></strong> with an emphasis on Music Business. That being said, I currently work as an <strong>SEO Strategist</strong> for a digital solutions company for the automotive industry. In this position I found myself spending a lot of time building webpages on various platforms like Wordpress and hacking a lot of code to make the pages prettier. I enjoyed what I was psuedo-learning, but I decided to attend the part-time <span class="namedrop">Intro To Programming</span> course with <span class="namedrop">Epicodus</span> because I wanted to truly be able to read and write code.  So here I am.  Rock you like a hurricane.</p>
          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>I love to travel and spend time out doors when I can. Time spent with friends going hiking, playing in a kickball league, camping at music festivals, shooting archery, white water rafting or just tubing down the Clackamas, these are just a few of my favorite things. I'm known to take an impromptu road trip or hopscotch across the country by plane for a couple of weeks at a time just to get a break from the monotony.  I've recently become more interested in photography and photo editing as well.</p>
